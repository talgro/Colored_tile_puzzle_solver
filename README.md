**About
This is my final project for "Problem solving using search algorithms".
This program gets a start state of an m*n colored tile puzzle as an input (input example is added).
The program then decides if the is a solution the input game board, and if exists, it asks the user for the desired algorithm to solve with.
The available algorithms are A*, BFS, DFBnB, DFID and IDA*.
After user selection, the program solves the the puzzle, and view how many states was expanded using the selected algorithm, and how long did it take.
